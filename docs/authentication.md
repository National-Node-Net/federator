# Federator Authentication and Authorization Process

Federator uses mutual TLS (mTLS) and JWT-based authentication and authorization throughout all client-server and client-IDP interactions.

## mTLS Authentication

- **Client to IDP:**
  - When a client starts, it authenticates to the Identity Provider (IDP, e.g., Keycloak) using mTLS.
  - The client presents its certificate to the IDP, which verifies the identity and issues a JWT token.
  - All properties for mTLS (keystore, truststore, passwords) are configured in `common-configuration.properties`.

- **Client to Server (Producer):**
  - The client establishes a secure connection to each producer/server using mTLS.
  - Both client and server verify each other's certificates, ensuring mutual trust and secure communication.

## JWT Token Acquisition and Usage

- After successful mTLS authentication with the IDP, the client receives a JWT token.
- The JWT token is attached to every request from the client to the management node and producer servers using an Auth Client Interceptor.
- The token contains claims that identify the client and its permissions.

## Server-Side Authorization

- When a server receives a request, it validates the JWT token:
  - Verifies the token signature using the IDP's JWKS endpoint.
  - Checks the token's expiration and other standard claims.
  - **Authorization:** The server checks the `aud` (audience) claim in the JWT to ensure the token is intended for this server or service. Only requests with valid audience claims are authorized to access protected resources.
- This process ensures that only authenticated and authorized clients can access server data and operations.

    else Not authorized
        ManagementNode-->>Client: Deny access
    end

    ProducerServer->>IDP: Validate JWT signature and claims
    IDP-->>ProducerServer: Confirm JWT validity
    ProducerServer->>ProducerServer: Check 'aud' claim for authorization
    alt Authorized
        ProducerServer-->>Client: Grant access / return data
    else Not authorized
        ProducerServer-->>Client: Deny access
    end
```

## Configuration Summary

- All mTLS and JWT properties are set in `common-configuration.properties`:
  - `idp.mtls.enabled`, `idp.keystore.path`, `idp.keystore.password`, `idp.truststore.path`, `idp.truststore.password`, `idp.jwks.url`, `idp.token.url`, `idp.client.id`, etc.
- All authentication and authorization is handled via mTLS and JWT tokens.

## Example Flow

1. **Client Startup:**
   - Loads configuration files and mTLS credentials.
   - Authenticates to IDP using mTLS and requests JWT.
2. **JWT Token Usage:**
   - Attaches JWT to all requests to management node and producer servers.
3. **Server Validation:**
   - Validates JWT signature and claims, including `aud` for authorization.
   - Allows or denies access based on token validity and audience.
