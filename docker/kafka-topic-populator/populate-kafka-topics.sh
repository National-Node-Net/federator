# This script creates kafka topics and populates them with data.
# Reads the environment variables KNOWLEDGE_TOPIC and KNOWLEDGE_DATA from the yml file
# The KNOWLEDGE_TOPIC is a string of kafka topics separated by space.
# The KNOWLEDGE_DATA is a string of data files separated by space.
# The script uses the KAFKA_BROKER_SERVER environment variable to connect to the kafka broker to create topics and populate data.
# The script uses the data separator value from the environment variable HEADER_SEPARATOR.
# The script uses the input data from the input/knowledge directory.
